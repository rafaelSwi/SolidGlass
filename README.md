# SolidGlass

A very simple application to disable the Liquid Glass effect in specific applications.

## What does SolidGlass do?

SolidGlass runs terminal commands to disable the Solid Glass effect for specific apps or system-wide.
While you could technically do this yourself through the terminal, SolidGlass simplifies the process with an intuitive interface and a collection of practical, easy-to-use features.

## For macOS BETA users

Disabling Liquid Glass isn't working in newer versions of macOS Tahoe beta. We don't know if this is a glitch caused by a system malfunction (which is quite possible), Apple changing how the disabling command works, or removing it completely. We'll just have to wait for the stable version to be released.
