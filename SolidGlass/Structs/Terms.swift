    1. Experimental Software
    SolidGlass is an experimental software application that uses development flags provided by Apple to test the behavior of various system components. SolidGlass is not an official or stable method of managing Liquid Glass on macOS and should not be used in environments requiring system stability or professional reliability.

    2. System Integrity
    SolidGlass does not modify, inject, or alter any internal files or installed applications on your system, it only enables/disables flags via shell commands.

    3. Disclaimer of Liability
    By using SolidGlass, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE DEVELOPER ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY ISSUES, malfunctions, data loss, or system instability that may occur on any macOS device as a result of using this software.

    4. Privacy
    SolidGlass operates completely offline and does not gather, send, or save any user data. The sole feature that requires internet access is a version check, which lets users know if an updated release of the software is available.
    
    5. Open Source and Distribution
    SolidGlass is open source, and modifications to the software are obviously allowed. However, any modified version must not be presented as an original SolidGlass build and should use a different name to avoid confusion (for example, ‘LiquidManager’). Under no circumstances may the software be distributed with malicious components. Anyone who violates this will be fully responsible for any legal consequences or judicial actions resulting from such distribution.
